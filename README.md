# HashTable
Hashtable implementation written by Jonathan Luetze

Main purpose of this program is to View, Enter, or Delete Tweets in the Hashtable.

The supplied tweets.txt file contains about 5000 tweets, which are read into the table before the user menu is displayed.

The user menu is displayed with 4 Options:
1. Enter a new Tweet - enters tweet with current date to user specified
2. Delete all tweets for a user
3. View tweets for a user - displays tweets sorted by date and time
4. Quit

Process:
1. Type "make" to create the executable
2. Type "./project4 tweets.txt" to start the program
3. Type "make clean" to remove the executable
